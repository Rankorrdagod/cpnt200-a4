## Issues
- Lotsa issues, getting things to connect to Netlify again. Eventually got it to show up partly, but for some reason links and images are broken on the Netlify site. I have poured over the documentation on Netlify and havent been able to find anything to useful? Im wondering if its a problem with the way the site is being generated in the dist folder? I've checked the html pages that are generated and they seem worng but I'm not sure how to fix it when everything looks fine and is showing on my local host... At a bit of a loss as to what to change to make things work correctly.
